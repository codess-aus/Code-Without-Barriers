## 🍰 What does “Enabler” mean?

An enabler helps you do more with what you already know.  
Copilot can:
- Refactor messy code
- Suggest improvements
- Write tests
- Add helpful comments
- Help you debug

But remember: **you’re still the baker**. Copilot just hands you better tools.

## 🧁 Refactoring with Copilot

Let’s say you’ve written a function that works, but it’s a bit messy:

```js
function bakeCupcakes(flavor, quantity) {
  if (quantity > 0) {
    console.log("Baking " + quantity + " " + flavor + " cupcakes");
  } else {
    console.log("No cupcakes to bake");
  }
}
```

Now prompt Copilot:

```js
// Refactor this function to use template literals and handle edge cases
```

Copilot might suggest:

```js
function bakeCupcakes(flavor, quantity) {
  if (quantity > 0) {
    console.log(`Baking ${quantity} ${flavor} cupcakes`);
  } else {
    console.log("Please enter a valid quantity of cupcakes to bake.");
  }
}
```

You’ve just leveled up your code with Copilot’s help!

## 🍩 Writing Tests with Copilot

Testing is a skill many coders avoid—but Copilot makes it easier.

### Example:
```js
// Write a test for the bakeCupcakes function
```

Copilot might generate:

```js
test('bakeCupcakes logs correct message', () => {
  console.log = jest.fn();
  bakeCupcakes('Vanilla', 3);
  expect(console.log).toHaveBeenCalledWith('Baking 3 Vanilla cupcakes');
});
```

Now you’ve got a test—and a better understanding of how to write one.

---

## 🍬 Adding Comments and Documentation

Copilot can help you document your code clearly.

### Example:
```js
// Add JSDoc comments to this function
function rateCupcake(flavor, rating) {
  return `${flavor} gets a ${rating}/5!`;
}
```

Copilot might suggest:

```js
/**
 * Rates a cupcake flavor.
 * @param {string} flavor - The flavor of the cupcake.
 * @param {number} rating - The rating from 1 to 5.
 * @returns {string} A formatted rating message.
 */
function rateCupcake(flavor, rating) {
  return `${flavor} gets a ${rating}/5!`;
}
```

Now your code is easier to read and maintain!

## 🎂 Debugging with Copilot

Stuck on a bug? Copilot can help you spot the issue.

### Example:
```js
// Why is this function returning undefined?
function getCupcake(flavor) {
  const cupcakes = { Vanilla: 5, Chocolate: 3 };
  cupcakes.flavor;
}
```

Copilot might suggest:
```js
// You need to use bracket notation to access dynamic keys
return cupcakes[flavor];
```

Boom! Bug fixed, lesson learned.
