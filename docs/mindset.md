# 🧠 The Mindset Shift

Welcome to the most important ingredient in your Coding & Cupcakes journey: **your mindset**! 🍰

GitHub Copilot is a powerful tool—but like any good kitchen assistant, it works best when **you’re in charge**. This section is all about helping you shift from passive coding to **active learning**.

## 🍩 Copilot is NOT your baker

Let’s get this straight:

❌ Copilot is **not** here to bake the cupcakes for you.  
✅ Copilot is here to **help you bake better cupcakes**.

Think of it like this:
- You bring the creativity, curiosity, and control.
- Copilot brings suggestions, explanations, and shortcuts.

## 🧁 What is “Vibe Coding”? And why avoid it?

**Vibe Coding** is when you let Copilot write code without understanding it. You vibe with the suggestions, accept them blindly, and hope for the best.

🚫 This leads to:
- Code you can’t debug
- Features you can’t explain
- Skills you don’t develop

Instead, we want to **learn actively**.
